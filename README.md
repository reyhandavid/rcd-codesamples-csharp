# C# Code Samples Repository

Welcome to the C# Code Samples repository! This is a collection of well-crafted C# code examples demonstrating clean code principles, design patterns, and best practices.

## 📚 Repository Structure

### SOLID Principles
Demonstrations of the five SOLID principles for object-oriented design:
- **[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](./SOLIDPrinciples/SingleResponsibility/)** - A class should have only one reason to change
- **[Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](./SOLIDPrinciples/OpenClosed/)** - Open for extension, closed for modification
- **[Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](./SOLIDPrinciples/LiskovSubstitution/)** - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- **[Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](./SOLIDPrinciples/InterfaceSegregation/)** - Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
- **[Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./SOLIDPrinciples/DependencyInversion/)** - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Design Patterns
Classic design pattern implementations in C#:
- **[Creational Patterns](./DesignPatterns/Creational/)** - Object creation mechanisms
  - Factory Pattern
  - Singleton Pattern
  - Builder Pattern
- **[Structural Patterns](./DesignPatterns/Structural/)** - Object composition
  - Adapter Pattern
  - Decorator Pattern
- **[Behavioral Patterns](./DesignPatterns/Behavioral/)** - Object collaboration and responsibilities
  - Strategy Pattern
  - Observer Pattern

### Clean Code Examples
Practical examples of clean code practices:
- **[Naming Conventions](./CleanCode/Naming/)** - Meaningful and consistent naming
- **[Error Handling](./CleanCode/ErrorHandling/)** - Robust exception handling

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A learning resource for C# developers
- A showcase of clean code and best practices
- Reference implementations for common patterns
- Examples of maintainable and testable code

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each directory contains:
- `README.md` - Detailed explanation of the concept
- Source code files demonstrating the concept
- Examples of both "before" and "after" implementations (where applicable)

Browse the directories above to explore different concepts and patterns.

## 💡 Key Principles Demonstrated

- **Clean Code**: Self-documenting code with meaningful names
- **SOLID Principles**: Foundation of maintainable object-oriented design
- **Design Patterns**: Proven solutions to common problems
- **Testability**: Code designed for easy testing
- **Separation of Concerns**: Proper organization and responsibilities

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

1. Browse by topic or principle you want to learn
2. Read the README in each directory for context
3. Study the code examples
4. Compare "before" and "after" versions to see improvements
5. Experiment with the code in your own projects
